> This research project aims to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with being labeled as "gifted" in educational experiences. I am interested in learning about the negative circumstances and feelings you have encountered in the past. Understanding these experiences can lead to improved educational outcomes when adequate support and regulations are implemented.
> The research format will be interviews. These will include open-ended questions aimed at encouraging a conversation. I am seeking to gain insight into your experiences rather than guiding you toward a specific response. Interviews will be conducted via Microsoft Teams. Names will be anonymized, and any details that could identify participants, such as job titles, will not be included in the project to protect participant privacy.
